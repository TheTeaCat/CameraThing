# CameraThing

This project is intended to be the epitome of a point-and-shoot camera. As soon as you take the photo it gets sent off to a cloud server which posts it to twitter with some (probably funny) captions generated by a tensorflow model (InceptionV3) trying to figure out what's in the photo you just took.

Behold!

![A photograph of the CameraThing; a small white cardboard box with a small camera lens poking out of a hole that has been crudely cut out of it, with an LED above and to the right and a button from a mechanical keyboard handing out above and to the left. The words "Camera Thing" have been written on the front of the box in sharpie.](./docs/imgs/CameraThing.jpg)



Details on how to construct a CameraThing can be found in `/camera-thing`.

Details on the cloud services on which the CameraThing depends can be found below, with more details in each service's subdirectory.



## Cloud Services

The CameraThing is currently dependent upon the following cloud services:

1. An instance of the "tweeter" service, in found in `/tweeter` of this repo.
2. An instance of `go-tensorflow-image-recognition`, which has been added as a git submodule to this repo and was **not written by me**.



### Local Development

The cloud services used by the CameraThing can be run locally with docker-compose like so:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:TheTeaCat/CameraThing.git
cd CameraThing
docker-compose up
```

Easy peasy!

The CameraThing simply queries the `/tweet` endpoint of the Tweeter service, which you can mock locally with the following curl command:

```bash
$ curl "localhost:8080/tweet?auth=dev&lat=53.36097329965131&long=-1.6899902029658576" -F 'image=@./test.jpg'
{"Tweet":"#Breakwater #Promontory #Seashore #GreyWhale #Wing (53.36097,-1.68999)"}
```

You do not need to have twitter credentials to test the tweeter service. For more details, see the docs in `/tweeter`.



### Deployment

Details on how to deploy the cloud services.

#### Heroku

The cloud services are dockerised and could easily be deployed to Heroku. Relevant docs for doing this can be found here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deploying-with-docker

#### Digitalocean/VPS

You can deploy to a digitalocean droplet or other VPS by SSHing into it, [installing docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), then doing:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:TheTeaCat/CameraThing.git
cd CameraThing
docker-compose up -d
```

You can then update by doing:

```bash
cd CameraThing
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

To view the logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f -t
```

## Future work

If I don't immediately disassemble my CameraThing to make something else, I might like to:

1. Connect all the modules properly (not using jumper wires).
2. Build a better housing for it - the camera doesn't sit straight stuck to the side of a cardboard box so it's hard to frame photos up properly. If it was mounted properly then it would make it much easier to register the position of the camera by feel like you can do with a regular camera.
3. Make the cloud services save the images to a filesystem and a database with their InceptionV3 labels and geolocations, then implement a searching service so I can make a webpage that allows you to search the images by their InceptionV3 labels and see them all on a map.
4. Expand the IO of the ESP32 so I can use a SIM800L and a GPS featherwing at the same time.
5. Swap out the InceptionV3 tensorflow model for a more accurate, or at least funnier one.
6. Do some more image processing server-side to correct for white balance in particular.
